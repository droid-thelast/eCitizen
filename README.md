# eCitizen

Software platform that helps citizens notifying problems on their territory.

Citizens can take pictures of urban problems and report them. Pictures are uploaded and gathered according to the type of reported problem (broken road, broken signalization, not working lights, etc.).

The platform extracts GPS coordinates from the pictures and visualise them all on a map. It also provides a heat map visualisation, which allows to immediately spot problematic urban areas.

Urban contractors (but also good citizens) can then easily react and fix them.

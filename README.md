# eCitizen

eCitizen is a project that helps local communities to improve. Members of community could report problems via website by uploading a picture of a problem (broken road, broken signalization, not working lights, etc.). From images we automatically extract the geolocation of the image. Managers of local community then can easily analyse these data by viewing images and heatmaps of the problems, react and fix them.
